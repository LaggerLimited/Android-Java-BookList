# BookList Application

BookList is an Android application that uses JSON to query the Google Books API and create a list of books. This operation is ran asynchronously in the background. After the user enters their search terms a ListView works along with a BookAdapter to populate the list. The list is inflated using view recycling to minimize load on the device. 

## Installation

Debug package for download:

[BookList App](https://github.com/LaggerLimited/Android-Java-BookList/blob/master/BookList-debug.zip)

## Usage

After installing the .APK file use the search bar at the top of the list to query the Google Books API. The list features the booksâ€™ picture, title, author, and price. More information can be displayed by selecting a book from the list.

## Java Code

* [Book Object](https://github.com/LaggerLimited/Android-Java-BookList/blob/master/BookList/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/booklist/Book.java): Represents one book entry returned from a search done on the Google Books API.

* [Book List Activity](https://github.com/LaggerLimited/Android-Java-BookList/blob/master/BookList/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/booklist/BookListActivity.java): Main Activity that initializes values, instantiates Views, and defines the asynchronous task.

* [Book Adapter](https://github.com/LaggerLimited/Android-Java-BookList/blob/master/BookList/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/booklist/BookAdapter.java): Inflates the array with book objects and handles the downloading of book images using asynchronous task.

* [QueryUtils](https://github.com/LaggerLimited/Android-Java-BookList/blob/master/BookList/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/booklist/QueryUtils.java): Helps request and receive book data by parsing JSON and creating book objects. 

## XML Code

* [Screen Layout](https://github.com/LaggerLimited/Android-Java-BookList/blob/master/BookList/app/src/main/res/layout/booklist_main.xml): Defines the ListView and describes how each list item will be displayed.

* [List Item](https://github.com/LaggerLimited/Android-Java-BookList/blob/master/BookList/app/src/main/res/layout/list_item.xml): Defines how the data will be displayed for each individual book.
